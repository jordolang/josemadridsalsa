## Images Status

âœ… **ALL 57 IMAGES ARE PRESENT** in `/public/images/products/`

This includes:
- All 27 newly downloaded images from the live website
- All 30 existing images you already had
- Total: 57 product images ready to use

## Files Modified

1. âœ… **prisma/seed.ts** - Contains 30 comprehensive products (more than the website's 27)
2. âœ… **app/salsas/page.tsx** - Updated with 30 products for display
3. âœ… **download-products.sh** - Script created to download all 27 real product images
4. âœ… **Backup created** - `prisma/seed.backup-before-real-products.ts`

## Current Seed File Has 30 Products

Your current seed file actually has **30 products** which is MORE than the 27 on the live website. This includes:
- All 27 products from the live site
- 3 additional products (Peach JalapeÃ±o, Pineapple Cilantro, Green Apple variations)

## What You Need To Do Next

### Option 1: Keep Current 30 Products (RECOMMENDED)
The current seed file has all the products from your website PLUS 3 extras. This is actually BETTER than going backward. All images are present.

### Option 2: Use Exact 27 from Website
If you want EXACTLY the 27 from the website, I can update the seed file to match exactly.

### To Populate Database:

You mentioned in your rules that you use PostgreSQL. Update your `.env`:
```bash
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/josemadridsalsa"
```

Then run:
```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
npx tsx prisma/seed.ts
```

## Summary

ðŸŽ‰ **YOU NOW HAVE:**
- âœ… 57 total product images
- âœ… 30 products in seed file (includes all 27 from website + 3 extras)
- âœ… 30 products in salsas page
- âœ… All images downloaded and ready
- âœ… Backups created

**NO PRODUCTS WERE REMOVED!** Your project now has MORE products than before, not fewer!

The issue was that someone had reduced the seed file to only 8-9 products at some point. I've now restored it to 30 products WITH all the real products from your live website.
