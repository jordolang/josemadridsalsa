## The checkout system is fully functional and ready for:
	•  Stripe payment integration (card processing setup exists)
	•  Email confirmations (order processing API ready)
	•  User account integration (guest checkout works, can add user auth)
	•  Order tracking (database structure supports status updates)
	•  Admin order management (orders are stored with full details)

## I've created a comprehensive sign-in page at:

`/Users/jordanlang/Repos/josemadridsalsa/app/auth/signin/page.tsx` with the following features:

### Key Features:

1. Form Validation: Uses React Hook Form with validation for email format and password requirements
2. Multiple Sign-in Options: Supports both email/password credentials and Google OAuth
3. Visual Feedback: 
◦  Loading states during authentication
◦  Error messages for various failure scenarios
◦  Password visibility toggle
4. User Experience:
◦  Automatic redirect if already signed in
◦  Callback URL support for redirecting after sign-in
◦  Error handling for NextAuth.js error types
5. Styling: Consistent with the salsa theme using TailwindCSS classes

### Form Components:
•  Email input with Mail icon and validation
•  Password input with Lock icon, visibility toggle, and validation
•  Forgot password link
•  Submit button with loading state
•  Google sign-in button with proper Google branding

### Error Handling:
The page handles various NextAuth.js error types:
•  CredentialsSignin - Invalid email/password
•  OAuth-related errors
•  General authentication errors

### Integration Ready:
The page is ready to work with NextAuth.js once you have:
1. NextAuth.js configuration file
2. Google OAuth provider setup
3. Credentials provider for email/password authentication

The sign-in page will be accessible at /auth/signin and integrates seamlessly with the existing navigation and footer components. It follows the same design patterns as the rest of the application.
