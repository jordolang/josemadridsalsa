                  The Restaurant That Started It All
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  In 1976, Mike Zakany and his brother started a restaurant in downtown Zanesville, Ohio. After months of planning and building, Zak's Restaurant was a reality. The contemporary casual restaurant was a welcome addition to the small urban center and was quite successful from the beginning.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
                  It was clear that the emerging ethnic food market was a logical niche for the Zakany brothers as their own Mexican heritage had a huge influence in the family kitchen. Estelle Zakany, the family matriarch, helped her sons integrate more authentic Mexican cuisine into the menu and life of the restaurant.

                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The Zakany family has always had a rich history as entrepreneurs. Mike's paternal grandparents opened a butcher shop and grocery store in Zanesville in 1942.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  Mike's father, uncle and entire family worked very hard to continue to grow the family business over the years. Zak's Restaurant was a natural extension of the Zakany's involvement and love for the food business.

                  Finding Their Niche
                </h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  The restaurant quickly developed a strong clientele. People clearly loved the "New Mexico" style food, and the phenomenal increase in "to go" food sales confirmed their niche.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
                  The demand for salsa was a key part of the complete menu‚Äîsalsa enhanced the flavors of all the dishes served. It then became time to develop the salsa to meet the demand.

              <p className="text-chile-100 leading-relaxed mb-6 text-lg">
                Mike started an extensive marketing study that examined all kinds of spices and chili peppers. He read with great interest about the migration patterns of the European Spaniards to Mexico and the influence America's native people had on the newcomer's cuisine.

              <p className="text-chile-100 leading-relaxed text-lg">
                Mike continued to work on the salsa recipes based on his research and experimentation. The restaurant customers were the critics for the salsa formulas born from Mike's hard work in the kitchen.

In 1987, Jos√© Madrid Salsa became a reality, named after the family icon and beloved grandfather from Clovis, New Mexico.
