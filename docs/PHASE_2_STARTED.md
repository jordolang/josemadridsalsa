## 📊 Statistics

### Phase 2 Progress
- **Overall**: 25% complete
- **Products**: 85% (list done, create/edit pending)
- **Categories**: 60% (view done, CRUD pending)
- **Tags**: 0% (not started)
- **Media**: 0% (not started)

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Products Filtering
The products page supports multi-dimensional filtering:
```typescript
// Supports combining filters
?search=habanero&category=xxx&heatLevel=HOT&active=true&page=2
```

### Permission Checks
All features respect the permission system:
- `products:read` - View products
- `products:write` - Create/edit (buttons disabled without it)
- `products:export` - Export functionality

### Performance
- Efficient queries with Prisma includes
- Pagination to limit data transfer
- Optimized with Promise.all for parallel queries
- Category dropdown populated from database

- Reusable filtering logic

### Code Quality
- ✅ TypeScript: No errors
- ✅ Linting: Clean (minor img warnings only)

1. Products API routes (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE, export)
2. Tags management page
3. Product create/edit form (if time allows)

### This Week
- Complete Products module
- Build Tags system
- Start Media library

### This Month
- Complete all Phase 2 features
