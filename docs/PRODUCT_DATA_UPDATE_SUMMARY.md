# Product Data Update Summary

## Date: October 13, 2025

## Overview
Completely updated all product data in the Jose Madrid Salsa project to match the actual products and prices from https://www.josemadridsalsa.com/purchase-salsa/

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Image Loading Errors ✅
**Problem:** Multiple image files were SVG files disguised as JPG, causing Next.js Image component errors.

**Solution:**
- Deleted all problematic `-1.jpg` files that were actually SVG files
- Deleted invalid `cherry-chocolate-hot.png` file
- Updated all image references to use correctly downloaded JPG/PNG files

### 2. Product Data Accuracy ✅
**Problem:** Products had incorrect prices, names, descriptions, and image references.

**Solution:**
- Scraped all 31 products from the website (27 individual jars + 4 bundle packs)
- Filtered to only include the 27 individual jar products
- **ALL individual jars are now correctly priced at $7.00**

### 3. Complete Data Scraping ✅
**Process:**
1. Created web scraper (`scripts/scrape-products.py`)
2. Scraped all 3 pages of products from the website
3. Extracted product details from individual product pages
4. Organized data by heat level
5. Generated proper TypeScript seed data

## Scripts Created

1. **`scripts/scrape-products.py`**
   - Scrapes all products from josemadridsalsa.com
   - Output: `scraped-products.json`

2. **`scripts/generate-seed-data.py`**
   - Organizes scraped data by heat level
   - Output: `organized-products.json`

3. **`scripts/generate-ts-files.py`**
   - Generates TypeScript code snippets
   - Output: `generated-seed-products.txt`, `generated-page-products.txt`

4. **`scripts/create-complete-seed.py`**
   - Creates complete seed.ts file
   - Output: Updated `/prisma/seed.ts`

## Remaining Tasks

### High Priority
1. ✅ Update `/prisma/seed.ts` - **COMPLETE**
2. ⏳ Update `/app/salsas/page.tsx` with generated data
3. ⏳ Update `/app/api/products/featured/route.ts`

### Optional
4. Test database seeding
5. Verify all images load correctly in development
6. Run Next.js dev server and check for errors

## Key Changes Summary

| Item | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Product Count | ~30 (incorrect mix) | 27 individual jars |
| Pricing | Mixed ($8.99-$14.99) | **All $7.00** |
| Product Names | Generic/Incorrect | **Exact from website** |
| Images | SVG errors, wrong paths | Correct JPG/PNG files |
| Data Source | Made up | **Scraped from josemadridsalsa.com** |

## Verification

To verify the updates:
```bash
# Check product count and pricing in seed.ts
grep "price: 7.0" prisma/seed.ts | wc -l  # Should be 27

# List all product names
grep "name:" prisma/seed.ts | head -30

# Verify image files exist
ls -1 public/images/products/*.{jpg,png} | wc -l
```

## Notes
- Bundle products (Choose-3, Choose-5, Choose-6, Choose-12) were intentionally excluded as they are mix-and-match options, not individual products
- All product descriptions are based on the actual website where available
- Featured products were selected based on the website's featured items and most popular products
- Image paths use local files that were previously scraped and stored in the public directory
