## Testing Checklist

- ⚠️ Manual testing recommended:
  - [ ] Fundraiser list display
  - [ ] Fundraiser stats accuracy
  - [ ] Status filtering (fundraisers)
  - [ ] Edit/View links work
  - [ ] Wholesale accounts list
  - [ ] Wholesale stats accuracy
  - [ ] Status filtering (wholesale)
  - [ ] Approve/Reject buttons display for PENDING
  - [ ] Pagination (both modules)
  - [ ] Permission checks

## Business Logic Notes

### Fundraiser Commission Calculation
```
Order Total × Commission Rate = Fundraiser Commission
Remaining Amount = Order Total - Fundraiser Commission
```

Example:
- Order Total: $100.00
- Commission Rate: 20%
- Fundraiser Gets: $20.00
- Store Keeps: $80.00

### Wholesale Discount Application
```
Product Price × (1 - Discount Rate) = Wholesale Price
```

Example:
- Product Price: $10.00
- Discount Rate: 25%
- Wholesale Price: $7.50

## Database Schema Highlights

### Fundraiser Fields
- `totalOrders`, `totalRevenue`, `totalCommission` - Auto-updated counters
- `isActive` - Quick toggle separate from status
- `slug` - URL-friendly identifier for public pages
- `goal` - Optional fundraising goal

### WholesaleAccount Fields
- `approvedBy` - Tracks which admin approved
- `approvedAt` - Approval timestamp
- `minimumOrder` - Optional minimum order requirement
- `discountRate` - Percentage discount (0-100)
